    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <h3><em>How does walkability drive the growth of local cafes in New York?</em></h3>
    <p><strong>Overview:</strong><br>
      This data-driven project investigates the hypothesis that <em>The number of independent coffee shops in a neighborhood correlates with the area's walkability score</em>. Inspired by the everyday experience of exploring cafés on foot, the project combines urban planning metrics with local business data to uncover patterns that link city design with lifestyle and culture.
    </p>
  
  
    <h4>Key Objectives:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Explore whether <strong>higher walkability correlates</strong> with more indie cafés</li>
      <li>Visualize how <strong>neighborhood size</strong> and <strong>population</strong> influence café density</li>
    </ul>
  
  
    <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
    <p>
      This project provides insight into how <strong>urban design influences local culture and economy</strong>, especially for small businesses. For city planners, designers, and lifestyle seekers, it prompts the question: <em>Could building more walkable neighborhoods cultivate richer community life?</em>

    <h2>Insights</h2>
    <p>
      The combination of walkability scores, neighborhood sizes, and café counts reveals a nuanced picture of how urban design intersects with local lifestyle in New York City. While the hypothesis—<em>that walkable neighborhoods support more independent coffee shops</em>—is largely supported by the data, the relationship is influenced by multiple factors beyond walkability alone.
    </p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Walkability strongly correlates with café presence.</strong>  
        Neighborhoods like <em>SoHo</em>, <em>Williamsburg</em>, and <em>Greenwich Village</em> rank high in both walkability and number of indie cafés, supporting the hypothesis. These areas benefit from dense mixed-use zoning, pedestrian traffic, and vibrant cultural appeal.
      </li>
  
      <li>
        <strong>Outliers highlight opportunity gaps.</strong>  
        Some highly walkable neighborhoods, such as parts of <em>Harlem</em> or <em>Washington Heights</em>, show room for café growth. This may reflect zoning restrictions, demographics, or lack of retail infrastructure.
      </li>
  
      <li>
        <strong>The presence of independent coffee shops reflects both urban design and culture.</strong>  
        Areas with artistic communities, student populations, and startup scenes tend to support more independent cafés, regardless of exact walkability scores.
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      Overall, the data affirms the idea that walkable urban spaces are fertile ground for small business ecosystems—but they thrive best when walkability intersects with density, culture, and human-centered urban planning.
